# MarvOut

A bot that notifies you when someone pushes to your GitHub repository and tells you who made the push.

I have not put the discord bot's token in this github's code. If you want to try this bot, please follow theses steps:
    -download the library dotenv.
    -create a file named ".env" with the following written inside: TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN, where YOUR_TOKEN is the token of your bot.

To run the bot discord, just play the bot_discord file. 
the keep_alive function will run on a different thread and will run a web server on the same time, so you can run the bot discord on a server like render and run it as a server web. if you  want more informations about it, please check the last part of this video (in french): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHF1dgwW6aw
